    "At the 2012 London Olympics, the top ten countries (plus the rest) receiving gold medals were `['USA', 'CHN', 'GBR', 'RUS', 'KOR', 'GER', 'FRA', 'ITA', 'HUN', 'AUS', 'OTHER']`. They received  `[46, 38, 29, 24, 13, 11, 11, 8, 8, 7, 107]` gold medals, respectively. Make a pie chart (use `plt.pie?` or go to the pie charts in the matplotlib gallery) of the top 10 gold medal winners plus the others at the London Olympics. Try some of the keyword arguments to make the plot look nice. You may want to give the command `plt.axis('equal')` to make the scales along the horizontal and vertical axes equal so that the pie actually looks like a circle rather than an ellipse. Use the `colors` keyword in your pie chart to specify a sequence of colors. The sequence must be between square brackets, each color must be between quotes preserving upper and lower cases, and they must be separated by comma's like `['MediumBlue','SpringGreen','BlueViolet']`; the sequence is repeated if it is not long enough."

Specify the `alpha` keyword, which defines the transparancy. Some experimentation will give you a good value for alpha (stay between 0 and 1).
