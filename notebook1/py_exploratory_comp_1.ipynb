For example, the variable `a`, which was defined earlier in this Notebook, still exist. It will be `6` unless you changed it in Exercise 1. The user decides the order in which code blocks are executed. For example, `In [6]` means that it is the sixth execution of a code block. If you change the same code block and run it again, it will get number 7. If you define the variable `a` in code block 7, it will overwrite the value of `a` defined in a previous code block. Variable names may be as long as you like (you gotta do the typing though). Selecting descriptive names aids in understanding the code. Variable names cannot have spaces, nor can they start with a number. And variable names are case sensitive. So the variable `a` is not the same as the variable `A`. The name of a variable may be anything you want, except for reserved words in the Python language. For example, it is not possible to create a variable `print = 7`, as `print` is a reserved word. You will learn many of the reserved words when we continue; they are colored green when you type them in the Notebook. "

      "Load the air and sea temperature, as used in Exercise 4, but this time make one plot of temperature vs the number of the month and use the `plt.fill_between` command to fill the space between the curve and the $x$-axis. Specify the `alpha` keyword, which defines the transparancy. Some experimentation will give you a good value for alpha (stay between 0 and 1). Note that you need to specify the color using the `color` keyword argument."
