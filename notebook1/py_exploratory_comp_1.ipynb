You may want to give the command `plt.axis('equal')` to make the scales along the horizontal and vertical axes equal so that the pie actually looks like a circle rather than an ellipse. There are four different ways to specify colors in matplotlib plotting; you may read about it [here](http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/color_demo.html). The coolest way is to use the html color names. Use the `colors` keyword in your pie chart to specify a sequence of colors. The sequence must be between square brackets, each color must be between quotes preserving upper and lower cases, and they must be separated by comma's like `['MediumBlue','SpringGreen','BlueViolet']`; the sequence is repeated if it is not long enough.
